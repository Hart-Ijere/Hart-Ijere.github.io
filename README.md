GuessMaster
Introduction
GuessMaster is an interactive number-guessing game that allows players to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10. Players are given hints whether their guess is too high or too low and are congratulated when they guess the correct number. Users can optionally log in to track their progress, allowing them to see their high scores.

This project is developed using Flask for the backend and vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end. The app provides a fun and engaging game experience while demonstrating simple login functionality, session management, and user feedback.
